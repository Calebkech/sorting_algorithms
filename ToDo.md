### General Instructions for Both Team Members

- Follow the specified coding standards.
- Document your code thoroughly.
- Create a README.md file with relevant project information.
- Push the header file (sort.h) to the repository.
- Test your code using provided main.c files and additional tests if needed.
- Address any auto reviews before the deadline.

## Testing

- Use provided main.c files for testing.
- Create additional tests if necessary.
- Ensure the correctness and efficiency of your sorting algorithms.
